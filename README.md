## Hello, I'm AndrÃ©s Biso! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with more than 5 years working on IT mainly on technologies like Angular and the .NET framework. I love FOSS and even thought I mostly work on Windows and on Mac I am always trying to use as much free software as possible.

I'm currently working on improving my skills as a developer and I'm eager to give a hand to Open Source projects.
